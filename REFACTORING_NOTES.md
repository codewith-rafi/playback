# Refactored Code Structure

## Overview
The app has been refactored to separate UI widgets into individual files for better organization and maintainability.

## File Structure

```
lib/
â”œâ”€â”€ main.dart                    # Main app logic and state management
â””â”€â”€ widgets/
    â”œâ”€â”€ recording_card.dart      # Recording UI widget with pulse animation
    â””â”€â”€ playback_card.dart       # Reusable playback card widget
```

## Changes Made

### 1. **Created `/lib/widgets/recording_card.dart`**
   - Displays the recording interface with:
     - Pulsing animation when recording
     - Real-time timer display
     - Start/Stop recording button
     - Dynamic gradient background (blue/cyan when idle, red/pink when recording)

### 2. **Created `/lib/widgets/playback_card.dart`**
   - Reusable widget for both Original and Reversed audio playback
   - Features:
     - **Pulse animation support** (fixes the animation issue!)
     - Progress bar during playback
     - Customizable colors and icons
     - Disabled state management

### 3. **Updated `/lib/main.dart`**
   - Added separate AnimationControllers for each playback card:
     - `_pulseController` - for recording animation
     - `_originalPulseController` - for original audio playback animation
     - `_reversePulseController` - for reversed audio playback animation
   
   - Animation lifecycle:
     - Starts when playback begins
     - Stops and resets when playback ends
   
   - Removed old widget build methods (~500 lines of duplicated code)
   - Now uses the new widget components

## Animation Fix

### The Problem
The original and reversed audio cards didn't animate because they shared the same animation controller that was always running.

### The Solution
Each playback card now has its own `AnimationController` that:
1. Only starts when that specific card begins playing
2. Stops and resets when playback completes
3. Creates the pulsing glow effect independently

### Code Example
```dart
// Start animation when playing
_originalPulseController.repeat(reverse: true);

// Stop animation when done
_originalPulseController.stop();
_originalPulseController.reset();
```

## Benefits

1. **Cleaner Code**: Main file reduced from ~870 lines to ~355 lines
2. **Reusability**: PlaybackCard can be used for any audio playback
3. **Maintainability**: Easy to find and modify specific UI components
4. **Fixed Animations**: Each card animates independently when active
5. **Better Organization**: Widget files are self-contained with their own logic

## Usage

### RecordingCard
```dart
RecordingCard(
  recording: _recording,
  duration: _duration,
  pulseAnimation: _pulseController,
  onStartRecording: _startRecording,
  onStopRecording: _stopRecording,
  isDisabled: _playingOriginal || _playingReverse,
)
```

### PlaybackCard
```dart
PlaybackCard(
  title: 'Original Audio',
  emoji: 'ðŸŽ§ ',
  isPlaying: _playingOriginal,
  hasFile: _filePath != null,
  playbackProgress: _playbackProgress,
  onPlay: _playOriginal,
  isDisabled: _recording,
  primaryColor: Colors.orange,
  secondaryColor: Colors.amber,
  tertiaryColor: Colors.yellow,
  icon: Icons.headphones_rounded,
  pulseAnimation: _originalPulseController,
)
```

## Testing

To verify the animations work:
1. Start recording â†’ Recording card should pulse
2. Stop recording â†’ Recording animation should stop
3. Play original audio â†’ Original card should pulse
4. Play reversed audio â†’ Reversed card should pulse

Each animation should be independent and only active during its specific operation.
